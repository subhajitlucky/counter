# Counter  

A simple counter application deployed on the Internet Computer (ICP) using Rust canisters. This project demonstrates basic smart contract functionality, including storing and updating a counter value.  

## Features  
- Increment and decrement the counter  
- Retrieve the current counter value  
- Built with Rust and the `ic-cdk` library  

## Getting Started  

### Install Dependencies  
Ensure you have the DFINITY SDK installed:  
```bash
dfx --version  # Check if DFX is installed  
```
If not installed, follow the [SDK setup guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install).  

### Run the Project Locally  
```bash
# Start the ICP replica
dfx start --background  

# Deploy the canister
dfx deploy  
```
Your application will be available at:  
`http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`  

### Interact with the Canister  
```bash
# Increment the counter  
dfx canister call counter increment  

# Get the counter value  
dfx canister call counter get_count  
```

This keeps it simple and to the point while providing everything needed to start and interact with the counter. Let me know if you want any modifications! ðŸš€
